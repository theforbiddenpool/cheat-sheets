# UI Design Fundamentals
## White Space & Alignment
__Notes:__
- Make sure the white space around an element is equal

## Contrast
__WCAG 2.0 Contract Guidelines__
_Minimum AA_
- text and images → 4.5:1
- large text → 3:1
	
_Enhanced AAA_
- text and images → 7:1
- large text → 4.5:1

You can check the contrast using Browser Plugins (search for wcag contrast), websites and UI Designs Application Plugins (e.g. Figma).\
You want a lot of constrast between important elements where the user is going to directly interact with (text, buttons), but besides that you don't have that requirement.
- A date on a blog post is not the main focus, so you don't need much constrast. However, it still has to be readable.
- The header must have a bigger constrast, and a slightly different color than the text below. It grabs the user attention.

## Scale
Scale is very important for visual hierarchy. Keep in mind the scale between headers and paragraphs. Dates can be smaller since they aren't as important.

## Typography
- Don't use more than 2 font families. Most of the times you can use only one.
- You can change the line height for easier reading (1.2 - 1.5).
- Use size to manipulate the visual hierarchy. Headings should be bigger, the author name smaller.
- You can use font styles (italic, bold) and color & constrast to stand something out.

## Color
> The first UI design fundamental that shapes a user's experience is color.
Different colors elicit a different meaning to the user. For example, green is associated with wealth, nature, growth whilst black with luxury, sophistication, elegance.

__Ask yourself:__
> Where do the users come from?
Colors mean different things for different cultures.

- Too many colors destroy the design.
- Choose colors that complement each other well.
- Use slightly different hues of the same color to reinforce certain part of the layout.

## Visual Hierarchy
You can use a conjuction of font size (scale), alignment, font styles and color & constrast to establish the visual hierarchy.\
The most important elements should be things that jump into the eye as soon as you see them. Lesser important things should be smaller, or have a lower contrast.

__Ask yourself:__
> What is the user most interested in? What is the most important element?
