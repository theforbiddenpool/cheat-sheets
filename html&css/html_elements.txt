	QUOTATIONS
<blockquote> -> used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Browsers tend to indent the contents of the <blockquote> element.
<q> -> used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the <q> element, however Internet Explorer does not.

	AUTHOR DETAILS
<address> -> is used to contain contact details for the author of the page. It can contain a physical address, phone number or email address. Browsers often display the content of <address> element in italics. (SEE: hCard microformat, for adding physical address information to you markup.

	CHANGES TO CONTENT
<ins> and <del> -> <ins> can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while <del> element can show text that has been deleted from it. The content of a <ins> element is usually underline, while the content of a <del> element usually  has a line through it.

name -> identifies the form control and is sent along with the information they enter the server.
maxlength -> limit the number of characters a user may enter into a field
placeholder -> value is text that will be shown in the text box until the user clicks in that area.

	SUBMIT BUTTON
type="submit" -> used to send a form to the server.
value -> used to control the text that appears on a button.

	IMAGE BUTTON

	BUTTON & HIDDEN CONTROLS
<button> -> was introduced to allow users more control over now their buttons appear, and to allow other elements to appear inside the button.

<input>
type="hidden" -> are not shown on the page. They allow web page authors to add values to forms that users cannot see. For example, a web page author might use a hidden field to indicate which page the user was on when they submitted a form.

	GROUPING FORM ELEMENTS
<fieldset> -> you can group related form controls together inside the <fieldset> element. Most browsers will show the fieldset with a line around te edge to show how they are related.
<legend> -> contains a caption which helps identify the purpose of that group of form controls.

	(HTML5)
<input>
type="date"
type="email"

type="search"

================================================
INFOMATION ABOUT YOUR PAGES
<meta> -> lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that webpage.

The most common attributes are the name and content attributes, which tend to be used together. These attributes specify properties of the entire page. The  value of the name attribute is the property you are setting, and the value of the content attribute is the  value that you want to give to this property.
Some defined values for this attribute that are commonly used are:
	. description -> contains a description of the page. This description is commonly used by search engines to understand what the page is about and should be a maximum of 155 characters. Sometimes it is also displayed in search engines results.
	. keywords -> contains a list of comma-separated  words that a user might search on to find the page.
	. robots -> indicates whether search engines should add this page to their search results or not. A value of noindex can be used if this page should not be added. A value of nofollow can be used if search engines should add his page in their results but not any pages that it links to.

The <meta> element also uses the http-equiv and content attributes in pairs.
	. author -> defines the author of the web page.
	. pragma -> prevents the browser from caching the page.
	. expires -> because browsers often cache the content of a page, the expires option can be used to indicate when the page should expire.


================================================
HTML5 ELEMENTS
<header> <footer> -> can be used for the main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site or a header or a footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

<nav> -> used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

<article> -> acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated. This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.

<aside> -> has two purposes, depending on whether it is an <article> element or not.
	. When the <aside> element is used inside an <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning.
	. When the <aside> element is used outside of an <article> element, it acts like a content that is related to the entire page.

<section> -> groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading. Because the <section> element groups related items together, it may contain several distinct <article> elements that have a common theme or purpose.

<hgroup> -> groups together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading.

<figure> -> it can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images). The article should still make sense if te content of the <figure> were moved. Examples of usage include: images, videos, graphs, diagrams, code samples and text that supports the main body of an article.
<figcaption> -> provides a text description for the content of the <figure> element.

	HTML5 TO OLDER BROWSERS
It should be placed inside a conditional comment which checks if te browser version is less than (hence te lt) IE9.
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/
trunk/html5.js"></script>
<![endif]-->

header, section, footer, aside, nav, article, figure {
display: block;
}

================================================
AUDIO
HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps wound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

	. controls -> shows the browser default play, pause and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. It's a boolean attribute.

E.G.
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>

================================================
ACCESSIBILITY
When information is in a visual format (like a chart), screen reader users need an alternative presentation (like a table) to access the data. An example of the CSS rules that accomplish this:

.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  left: -10000px;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  top: auto;
  overflow: hidden;
}

display: none or visibility: hidden hides content for everyone, including screen reader users, and zero values for pixel sizes (such width:0px) removes that element from the flow of your document, meaning screen readers will ignore it.


accesskey attribute -> used to specified a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element. HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it's particularly useful when it's used with interactive ones (links, buttons, form controls, etc.)
	e.g: <button accesskey="b">Important Button</button>

tabindex attribute -> it indicates that element can be focused on and the value (an integer +, - or 0) determines the behavior. A negative value indicates that an element is focusable, but is not reachable by the keyboard. Adding this attribute on p, span and divs also enables the CSS pseudo-class :focus.
	It can also specifies the exact tab order of elements. This is achieved when the value of the attribute is set to a positive number of 1 or higher. This also will bring keyboard focus to that element first. Then it cycles through the sequence of specified tabindex values, before moving to default and tabindex="0" items.
