__Agile__ → methodology for approaching software development. It consists of different frameworks such as SCRUM or Kanban that help teams continously build, test, and gather feedback on their product. It consists of four core principles:
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools;
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation;
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation;
4. Responding to change over following a plan.

## The Waterfall Method
__Waterfall__ → linear approach to building a product. A development practice previously used.
1. __Requirements__: teams spend weeks/months drafting product requirement documents. One massive document is put together outlining the product requirements in extreme detail.
2. __Design__: the architecture for the software is developed.
3. __Implementation__: everything is coded.
4. __Verification__: bug fixing.
5. __Maintenance__: the product is shipped to production, and maintenance commences.

This is a very long and laborious process in which some things get missed. There's no flexibility to implement changes, and the client is not included in the process. The waterfall methodology waits to deliver the whole product until the very end.

## How Agile Solved Waterfall Method Problems
Agile allows product development teams to continously build features that add value. The teams also are able to get feedback on their work and make changes as necessary.

Teams consistenly <mark>ship small pieces of code to production at a rapid pace</mark>. Testing also goes faster since we are only testing the compatibility of the latest piece of code.
1. A single small feature is requested.
2. The feature is coded and tested.
3. Feedback is gotten.
4. If the client is happy, it's then shipped to production.

## The Principles
#### #1: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Instead of forcing people to comform to strict ideation and specifications, we give them more space to experiment. Individual team members can innovate.

#### #2: Working software over comprehensive documentation
Instead of verbose specifications and planning, just write a few lines of code that work. Test it, get feedback, and shit it.

#### #3: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Build something small and see if your customers like it. If they do, keep going. This promotes a quick feedback loop to get the customer involved.

#### #4: Responding to change over following a plan
Using Agile teams can respond to change by listening to customer feedback and making necessary adjustments. Roadmaps always change.
