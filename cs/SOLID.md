## Single Responsability Principle
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. A class should only have one responsability.

## Open/Closed Principle
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. An overriden method of a class needs to accepts the same input parameter and return the same return value as the method of the superclass.

## Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstrations. Abstrations should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. High-level modules, which provide complex logic, should be easily reusable and unaffected by changes in low-level modules, which provide utility features.
