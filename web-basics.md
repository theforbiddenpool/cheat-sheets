# SSL, TLS, HTTPS and SSH
__SSL and TLS__ → protocols that encrypt your data sent across a network. SSL in the older version renamed in 1999 to TLS. We are currently on TLS 1.3.

__HTTPS__ → is HTTP wrapped in TLS. However TLS is not specific to HTTP only.

__SSH__ → cryptographic protocol. Used to securely execute commands on a remote server. Designed as a secure replacement for telnet, rsh or rlogin.
